description: Cut a zen-review release end to end. Resolves the version from the commit range, checks the docs that are about to represent a shipped version, curates docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md into copy for the person downloading, runs the gate, hands over the tag command, then verifies what actually published. Manual invocation only, never auto-run: use it when Drew asks to cut a release, not because main looks ready.

# Release (zen-review)

`.github/workflows/release.yml` already handles the mechanical half: it runs the
tests, cross-compiles five targets, writes the checksums, and cuts the release
from the notes in the tagged commit. This skill does not reimplement any of it.

What it does not do is judgement. Which commits a stranger cares about, what the
version should be, whether a doc about to become the documentation for a shipped
version is still true, and how the notes read. That is this skill.

**Say almost nothing.** Apply these rules silently. Never restate a rule or
justify a step you are about to take. When a rule stops you, name what is blocked
in one line and what you need to continue.

**Drew pushes the tag.** Phases 1 to 5 stop at handing over the command. A
published tag is permanent and cannot be renumbered. Phase 6 resumes once he
reports it pushed: a release is not done until the artifacts are verified.

## 1. Scope the release

- `git fetch --tags`, then confirm `main` is checked out, clean, and even with
  origin. Anything else stops here. Local `main` silently carrying commits that
  never reached origin is a real state this has been in, and tagging it cuts a
  release from a tree nobody reviewed.
- `git log <last-tag>..HEAD --no-merges` for the range. History is one squash
  commit per PR, so the commit titles are the unit.
- Sort every commit into **user-facing** or **internal**, and show the split.
  Internal work is most of a typical range: CI, agent config, refactors,
  test-only changes. It does not appear in the notes.
- A commit is user-facing if someone who only runs the tool would notice, or if
  it changes what they download, install, or read.

Then propose the bump. `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` under "Version numbers" governs
which, and **get Drew's confirmation before going further.**

## 2. Check the docs that ship with it

`README.md` and `docs/*.md`, against the range.

This matters more here than at merge time. A doc that is wrong at this moment
becomes the documentation for a shipped version, and the release page links into
it.

`docs/install.md` earns the most attention. It names the platforms the release
carries, the requirements, where the binary lands, and what `--version` reports.
All four are claims a release makes true or false, and three of them changed in
the same PR that added the workflow.

Fix what the range made wrong before writing the notes.

## 3. Curate the notes

Write `docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`, for the person downloading rather than the
person who wrote the patch. Drew's voice: terse, considerate, stoic, no strong
adverbs, no em-dashes.

Structure, as `v0.1.0.md` establishes it:

- `# vX.Y.Z`, then one line saying what this release is.
- `## New` / `## Fixed` / `## Changed`, only the ones that apply. Bold lead-in
  naming the thing, then plain sentences about what changed.
- `## Install`.
- `## Known gaps`, where there are any worth naming.

Check `## Install` against what `docs/install.md` currently says rather than
copying the previous file forward. It goes stale the moment a platform or an
install path changes, and it is the section a reader acts on.

There is no card block and no appcast. Nothing reads these but a person on the
release page.

Run the mechanical checks before showing anything. They are cheap and catch what
rereading your own copy does not:

```sh
grep -c '—' docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md    # must be 0
grep -nEi 'seamless|powerful|beautiful|just works|simply|easily|quickly' docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md
```

Then show Drew the notes and get approval. Copy is the deliverable here.

## 4. Gate

`make all`, fully green: gofmt, go.mod tidiness, golangci-lint, the race suite,
and the build. Run it directly, never through a pipe that swallows the exit code.

## 5. Hand over

Commit the notes to `main`. Doc-only changes go straight to `main` here, and the
pre-push hook rejects pushes to it, so the commit is yours and the push is his.

Then give Drew both commands, in this order, with the version named explicitly:

```sh
git push origin main
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "zen-review vX.Y.Z" && git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

**`main` first, and it is not a style preference.** The release job checks out
the tag and reads `docs/release-notes/${GITHUB_REF_NAME}.md` out of it. A tag cut
before the notes commit is on `main` fails the run, and the tag is already
published by then.

The hook guards `refs/heads/main` only, so the tag pushes without `--no-verify`.
Never suggest `--no-verify` for either.

Stop here. Do not run them.

## 6. Verify what published

Resume once Drew reports the tag pushed, and check what landed rather than
trusting the workflow's exit code.

- `gh release view vX.Y.Z --json assets` shows **six** assets: four tarballs, the
  windows zip, and `checksums.txt`. A missing archive is a matrix leg that failed
  after the others published.
- Download one archive and match it against the published checksum. The
  checksums are generated in a different job from the builds.
- **Run the installer against the live release**, with `INSTALL_DIR` at a scratch
  path. Nothing before a release exists can exercise its download path, so this
  is the only time it is ever tested.
- The installed binary reports the version rather than `dev`. A `dev` here means
  the ldflags stamp broke, and the binary is otherwise fine, which is why nothing
  else catches it.
- Run it against a real repository, not just `--version`.

No Linear status work. Shipped tickets are already Done from their merges.

## Hand back

```text
## Released vX.Y.Z

**Release** <link>

**Shipped**
- <what a user gets>

**Verification**
- Assets — <n> of 6
- Checksum — <matched or not>
- Installer — <result against the live release>
- Version — <what the installed binary reports>

**Known gaps**
- <what shipped unfinished, and where it is tracked>
```

The run is not complete while an asset is missing, a checksum is unmatched, the
installer is untested against the live release, or the binary reports `dev`.
